# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple game contained entirely in a bash script where players must guess a number.

The game identifies players by username and keeps track of the number of games they've played and the least amount of gueesses it took for them to arrive at the correct number.

It's a simple bash / PostgreSQL exercise.
